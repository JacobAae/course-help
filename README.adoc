= Course Help Repository

== Structure of the Repository

The structure of the repository should be this:

----
.
├── <COURCE-CODE>
|   ├── Exam-notes
|   ├── Lecture-notes
|   ├── Tutorials
|   ├── Code
|   |    └── <PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME>
|   |         └── <PROGRAMMING PROJECT NAME>
|   └── README.adoc
...
├── <META-NAME>
└── README.adoc
----

The `<COURCE-CODE>` is uppercase and numbers only, the `README.adoc` file in each directory will have the name and
description of the content.

`<META-NAME>` is for folders like _latex_ that is general help, and not course specific.

Each course can have multiple programming languages.
